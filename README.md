## What Is VRCSchool?

VRCSchool is a repository of useful Avatar 3.0 knowledge created by the combined efforts of JustSleightly and VRLabs.

It was originally made in Notion, but moved to docusaurus to make it open source and encourage community contribution.

Spot any issues or want to contribute? Feel free to open a PR!

If you want to add new pages, it is recommended to ask one of maintainers if the page would fit VRCSchool first.
