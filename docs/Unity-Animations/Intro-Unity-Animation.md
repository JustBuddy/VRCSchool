# Introduction - Unity Animation {#47b3c43471464a28a1a24406505b9a7d}


This series is tailored for those diving into the Unity Animation system, aiming for a solid grasp to construct advanced custom systems. Unlike quick fixes for VRChat toggles, our focus is on building a comprehensive understanding.


While not a substitute for the [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html), this series acts as an organized supplement. It's designed to facilitate learning for those who find official manuals challenging to navigate.


If youâ€™re looking for a more VRChat-oriented animation curriculum, please check out [Introduction - VRChat Avatars 3.0](/docs/Avatars/Intro-VRChat-Avatars).
