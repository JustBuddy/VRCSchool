# Introduction - VRChat Avatars 3.0 {#128d8f78200746e89fddd8d98e59274b}


This series is tailored for learning the basic/intermediate fundamentals of the Avatar 3.0 system.


While not a substitute for the [VRChat Documentation](https://creators.vrchat.com/), this series acts as an organized supplement. It's designed to facilitate learning for those who find official manuals challenging to navigate.
